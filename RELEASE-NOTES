Release Notes for Oasys
----------------------
1.6.0 (July 2012)

New features:
=============

- Improved support for ODBC-based storage databases based on SQLite 
  implementation in Oasys 1.5.0.

    * Full implementation for MySQL

    * Improved implementation for SQLite

    * Base ODBC support factored out to allow easier addition of other 
      ODBC interfaces (e.g., PostgreSQL)

    * Support of key types other than integer for the main tables 
      managed by Oasys (needed for Links and PRoPHET)

    * Support for 'auxiliary' tables tied to particular main tables 
      in an ODBC database. Auxiliary tables can have multiple data 
      columns instead of the single 'blob' column containing 
      (typically) a serialization of a complete data structure 
      instance with generic support for connecting data items with 
      the associated column in the auxiliary table. The intention 
      is that auxiliary table rows are tied to corresponding main
      table rows using SQL triggers to ensure referential integrity.

    * Additional storage configuration to identify SQL scripts that
      can be executed before and after the main SQL tables are created
      to create the auxiliary tables and associated triggers as well as 
      doing any other non-standard additions to the database schema. 

Bug fixes:
==========
- Enforced check for existence of a suitable version of Xerces-C when 
  configuring Oasys. Oasys requires version 2.x rather than version 3.y
  with x >= 6.  Version 3 has a different interface and cannot be used.

- Corrections to configuration of search paths when installing Oasys or 
  using it with another package wuch as DTN2.

- Corrections to dummy begin_transaction and end_transaction routines 
  that are implemented in storage types that do not support transactions.
