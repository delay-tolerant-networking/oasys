* Integrate expandable buffer into StreamBuffer
* Integrate serializestream into the marshallers
* MemoryStore serialization is wrong -- uses string serialize to
  marshal keys, then unmarhsals the keys
* Should really change all the serialization stuff to be char* not
  u_char*. What the hell was I thinking when I wrote that.
